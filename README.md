## 🧠 About Me

I'm Atique Abdullah — a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a deep curiosity for intelligent systems. I specialize in building end-to-end ML solutions that go beyond academic prototypes — systems that scale, adapt, and create real-world impact.

I believe in **educating machines** not just to perform tasks, but to **reason**, **optimize**, and **continuously improve**. Whether it's through deep learning, classical ML, or automation pipelines, my work focuses on making machines think a little smarter every day.
